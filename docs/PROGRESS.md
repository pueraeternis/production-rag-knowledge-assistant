## 2026-06-21 — Python Bootstrap

**Plan:** [02-python-bootstrap.md](plans/completed/02-python-bootstrap.md)

Established the Python project foundation:

* created `pyproject.toml` with `src` layout, `uv` configuration, and development dependency groups;
* generated `uv.lock` with tooling-only dependencies (`ruff`, `basedpyright`, `pytest`);
* created `src/knowledge_assistant/` package skeleton aligned with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
* configured ruff, basedpyright, and pytest;
* added `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, and `tests/smoke/` layout with package import smoke tests;
* documented setup and validation workflow in `README.md`.

Bootstrap validation exception is superseded. All commits must pass the standard quality commands.
