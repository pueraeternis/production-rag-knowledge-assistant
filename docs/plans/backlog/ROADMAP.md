# Roadmap

**Status:** Informational

This document describes the planned evolution of Production RAG Knowledge Assistant.

The roadmap is informational only.

Authorized implementation scope is defined exclusively by active plans.

---

# Project Progression

The project has completed architecture construction (foundation through evaluation framework). Remaining work moves toward a working educational demo:

```text
Foundation
→ Retrieval
→ MCP
→ Agent
→ Evaluation
→ Knowledge Corpus
→ Demo Bootstrap
→ Real Models
→ Benchmark Evaluation
→ Interactive Demo
```

Phases 1–8 are complete. Phases 9–14 deliver corpus content, demo workflow, real model integration, benchmark evaluation, and interactive chat.

---

# Phase 1 — Foundation

Goal:

Establish project structure, development workflow, and architectural boundaries.

Plans:

* Plan 01 — Project Bootstrap *(completed)*
* Plan 02 — Python Bootstrap *(completed)*

Deliverables:

* repository structure
* uv project
* quality tooling
* package layout
* development workflow

---

# Phase 2 — Core Domain

Goal:

Define the core data model shared across all system layers.

Plans:

* Plan 03 — Domain Models *(completed)*

Deliverables:

* Document
* Chunk
* SearchResult
* SourceReference
* Indexing models
* Retrieval models

Notes:

Domain models should remain implementation-agnostic and independent from Qdrant, LangGraph, MCP, and LlamaIndex.

---

# Phase 3 — Storage and Indexing

Goal:

Build the document ingestion pipeline.

Plans:

* Plan 04 — Storage Layer *(completed)*
* Plan 05 — Indexing Pipeline *(completed)*

Deliverables:

* Qdrant integration
* document loading
* chunking
* embedding generation (stub provider)
* indexing workflow

Key Principle:

Indexing and retrieval are separate concerns.

---

# Phase 4 — Retrieval

Goal:

Implement production-style retrieval.

Plans:

* Plan 06 — Dense Retrieval *(completed)*
* Plan 07 — Sparse Retrieval *(completed)*
* Plan 08 — Fusion *(completed)*
* Plan 09 — Reranking *(completed)*

Deliverables:

* vector retrieval
* BM25 retrieval
* rank fusion
* reranking (stub reranker)

Target Pipeline:

Dense Search
+
BM25 Search
↓
Fusion
↓
Reranker
↓
Top Context

Notes:

Dense, sparse, and reranker paths use development stubs. Real model runtimes are deferred to Phases 11–12.

---

# Phase 5 — Knowledge Access

Goal:

Expose retrieval capabilities through MCP.

Plans:

* Plan 10 — Knowledge MCP Server *(completed)*

Deliverables *(Plan 10 — implemented)*:

* `search_documents` — ranked chunk retrieval with source attribution
* `index_documents_preview` — indexing impact preview without storage mutation
* `index_documents_apply` — indexing mutation after explicit human approval

Deferred *(not part of Plan 10; future plans)*:

* `get_document` — repository document browse (Tier 2)
* `get_statistics` — index diagnostics (Tier 2)
* URL indexing — remote source ingestion (ADR-011 local sources only in Plan 05/10)
* MCP SDK runtime and transport — handler layer only in Plan 10 (ADR-034); agent uses in-process adapters per Plan 12 (ADR-043 design)
* MCP resources (`knowledge://…` URIs)

Notes:

Local indexing sources accept file or directory paths (`.md`, `.txt`). Directory sources are recursively discovered before indexing. Index modification operations require human approval via `approval_confirmed=True` on the apply handler.

---

# Phase 6 — LLM Integration

Goal:

Introduce model interaction boundaries.

Plans:

* Plan 11 — LLM Boundary *(completed)*

Deliverables *(Plan 11 — implemented)*:

* OpenAI-compatible `LLMClient` chat protocol
* generation settings and environment configuration
* typed LLM message, generation, and tool-call transport contracts (`ChatMessage`, `ToolDefinition`, `ToolCall`, `GenerationResult`)

Notes:

“Prompt contracts” in this phase means **typed LLM transport contracts**, not RAG or system prompt templates. RAG prompt templates, citation rendering, and agent-side prompt assembly were delivered in Plan 12.

---

# Phase 7 — Agent Layer

Goal:

Build the conversational assistant.

Plans:

* Plan 12 — LangGraph Agent *(completed: [12-langgraph-agent.md](../completed/12-langgraph-agent.md))*

Deliverables *(Plan 12 — implemented)*:

* LangGraph agent orchestration (`agent_node`, `tool_node`, conditional routing)
* conversation handling with in-memory graph state
* MCP Tier 1 tool adapters (`search_documents`, `index_documents_preview`, `index_documents_apply`)
* RAG prompt templates with citation contract
* tool registry and max tool-iteration guard

Deferred *(not part of Plan 12; future plans)*:

* query rewriting and retrieval retry — proposed **Plan 12b**
* MCP SDK client/server transport — proposed **Plan 12c**
* durable conversation memory and LangGraph checkpointers

Interactive CLI chat UX is deferred to Phase 14 (Plan 19).

---

# Phase 8 — Evaluation

Goal:

Measure retrieval quality and demonstrate production practices.

Plans:

* Plan 13 — Evaluation Framework *(completed: [13-evaluation-framework.md](../completed/13-evaluation-framework.md))*

Deliverables *(Plan 13 — implemented)*:

* retrieval metrics (Hit Rate@K, Recall@K, MRR)
* committed retrieval benchmark (`data/evaluation/retrieval_benchmark_v1.json`)
* `EvaluationRunner` and strategy comparison (`ComparisonReport`)
* evaluation layer in `knowledge_assistant.evaluation`

Deferred *(not part of Plan 13; future plans)*:

* CLI subcommand wiring for evaluation output — Phase 13 (Plan 18)
* full-benchmark integration tests against indexed corpus — Phase 13 (Plan 18)

**Next roadmap phase:** Phase 11 — Real Embedding Models (Plan 16).

---

# Phase 9 — Synthetic Knowledge Base

Goal:

Create the canonical AcmeCloud Analytics enterprise corpus.

Plans:

* Plan 14 — Synthetic Corporate Knowledge Base *(completed: [14-synthetic-knowledge-base.md](../completed/14-synthetic-knowledge-base.md))*

Scope:

* 80–100 markdown documents
* realistic company structure
* cross-linked documentation
* policies
* runbooks
* platform architecture docs
* RFCs
* postmortems
* internal service catalog

Deliverables *(Plan 14 — implemented)*:

* corpus specification — [14-synthetic-knowledge-base.md](../completed/14-synthetic-knowledge-base.md)
* tracked generator assets under `tools/knowledge_generator/` with manifest, templates, and quality gates
* local generated corpus — **96** markdown files under gitignored `knowledge/` (regenerate: `python3 tools/knowledge_generator/generator.py`)
* `knowledge/README.md` corpus index (generated locally)
* benchmark-aligned policy and procedure paths for `retrieval_benchmark_v1.json`
* `.gitignore` entry for `knowledge/`

Notes:

This phase is **content-only**. No retrieval, indexing, CLI, MCP, agent, or model changes.

Generated corpus files are **not** source-controlled. The repository tracks the specification, generator, templates, manifest, quality gates, and regeneration instructions.

The local `knowledge/` tree is the single canonical knowledge base for demo bootstrap, benchmark evaluation, and interactive chat after generation. Fresh clones can regenerate it with `python3 tools/knowledge_generator/generator.py`. Do not create a separate demo corpus.

---

# Phase 10 — Demo Bootstrap Experience

Goal:

Provide a zero-to-working-demo experience.

Plans:

* [Plan 15 — Demo Bootstrap Workflow](../completed/15-demo-bootstrap-workflow.md) *(completed)*

User flow:

```text
git clone
docker compose up
rag demo load
rag chat
```

Scope:

* CLI demo commands
* corpus discovery against `knowledge/` from Plan 14
* indexing execution
* collection initialization
* demo status commands

Commands:

* `rag demo info` — corpus and index status
* `rag demo load` — index the canonical corpus
* `rag demo reset` — reset demo index state

Notes:

The workflow must use the canonical knowledge corpus created in Plan 14. Do not create a separate demo corpus.

Interactive chat is deferred to Phase 14 (Plan 19). This phase delivers bootstrap and indexing only.

---

# Phase 11 — Real Embeddings Integration

Goal:

Replace stub embedding providers with production models.

Plans:

* Plan 16 — Real Dense Embeddings Integration *(completed — [16-real-dense-embeddings-integration.md](../completed/16-real-dense-embeddings-integration.md))*

Scope:

* BAAI/bge-m3
* indexing embeddings (`EmbeddingProvider`)
* retrieval query embeddings (`QueryEmbeddingProvider`)

Notes:

Indexing sparse vector generation remains a separate concern (see ADR-020). This plan targets dense embedding paths only.

---

# Phase 12 — Real Reranker Integration

Goal:

Replace stub reranker with production cross-encoder.

Plans:

* Plan 17 — Real Reranker Integration *(backlog — not yet authored)*

Scope:

* BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3

---

# Phase 13 — End-to-End Evaluation

Goal:

Run Dense vs Sparse vs Fusion vs Rerank against the evaluation benchmark using real indexed corpus data.

Plans:

* Plan 18 — Retrieval Strategy Evaluation *(backlog — not yet authored)*

Scope:

* index canonical corpus (via Plan 15 bootstrap or equivalent wiring)
* run all four retrieval strategies through `EvaluationRunner`
* produce side-by-side strategy comparison

Outputs:

* `ComparisonReport`
* retrieval metrics
* benchmark results

Notes:

Requires Plan 14 corpus, Plan 15 bootstrap workflow, and real model integration (Phases 11–12) for meaningful results. Framework and benchmark from Plan 13 are prerequisites.

---

# Phase 14 — Interactive Chat Experience

Goal:

Deliver the user-facing conversational demo.

Plans:

* Plan 19 — Interactive Chat Experience *(backlog — not yet authored)*

Scope:

* CLI chat (`rag chat`)
* agent integration
* MCP integration
* source citations
* conversational demo UX

Notes:

Completes the lecture demonstration path begun in Phase 10. Depends on indexed corpus, real models, and working agent/MCP wiring.

---

# Architectural Priorities

The project prioritizes:

1. Retrieval quality
2. Source attribution
3. MCP integration
4. Agent orchestration
5. Realistic demo experience

The project does not prioritize:

* multi-agent systems
* distributed infrastructure
* production deployment
* enterprise platform features

The retrieval layer is the most important subsystem in the project.

All higher-level functionality depends on retrieval quality.
